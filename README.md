## Data Scientists vs Students: What does it take for a student to evolve into a data scientist?Â¶

This is Max Vu's project submission to the 2019 Kaggle Machine Learning And Data Survey Challenge. The goal of this project is to investigate the differences between data science students and full-time data scientists, with the motivation of discovering insights that can help the transition from the former to the latter. 

The analysis is split into 3 main parts. The first part examine the attributes of the data scientist role, with particular attention to salary, task performed on the job, team size and company size. Understanding these attributes were important to recognize why the data scientist title is sought after by students. The second part looks at the differences between data scientists and students based on attributes including gender distribution, age distribution, level of education and coding experience. These insights offer a basic picture of the fundamental differences between these two groups. In the third part, the analysis closely examined the differences in the toolkits of data scientists and students. The survey asked my questions regarding the preferences for tools, programming language, machine learning algorithm, etc, which contribute to the understanding of what people in the kaggle community is working with. This part offers the most insight into the difference in term of technical attribution between data scientists and students, and help to derive the most answers to help students take action to become a data scientist.

This analysis was done in a Jupyter Notebook, with visualization produced by MatplotLib and Seaborn libraries.
